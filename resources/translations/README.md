# Translations
Translations for [QOLMod](https://github.com/TheSillyDoggo/GeodeMenu/).

## File names:
File names are set to `bo-OB.json`, where:
`bo` is a **two** letter language code, seen [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes)
`OB` is a **two** letter region code, seen [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes)

### For example
Japanese would be `ja-JP.json`

## Contributing:

### Copying base
Copy the `en-AU.json` file from the root directory into the **langs** folder.
Change the name of this file to the **correct** region name.

### Edit the language info at the top
Change `display_name_english` to the name of the language in **English**.
Change `display_name_native` to the name of the language as written in the language.

For Japanese this would be
```json
"display_name_english": "Japanese",
"display_name_native": "日本語",
```

### What languages can I translate it into?
No English language translations, the only english variant is en-AU.
No Arabic languages - Cocos struggles to render the letters correctly on some platforms, resulting in unreadable text
No Hebrew - Cocos just straight up won't render the letters at all

### Can I use Google Translate / Chat GPT / Other translation tools

**No.**
All translations must be done by a real person.

### Actual Translation
There is a section of the file called `strings`.
In this object there are the strings for the mod.
The Key (value on the left) is how the mod menu finds the text.
You add the translated text **after** this text.
**DO NOT MODIFY THE TEXT ON THE LEFT**

### Useful Info

You can use the tags `<bm>` and `<ttf>` to force bitmap font or ttf font usage.
bitmap font is the normal font (like pusab).
ttf is the custom font added for the language

### Crediting yourself
There is a `contributors` array at the top of the file.
This is for adding credits to yourself by linking your **gd profile**.

An example credits is this:
```json
"contributors": [
    {
        "username": "TheSillyDoggo",
        "account-id": 16778880,
        "icon-id": 373,
        "primary-col": 12,
        "secondary-col": 98,
        "glow-enabled": true,
        "glow-col": 12,
        "death-effect-id": 3
    }
],
```

### Thank you!
Thank you for helping contribute to QOLMod.
This means a lot and without **YOUR** help translations would not have been possible.
